# Medieval Password Quest

Welcome to Medieval Password Quest, a Unity-based interactive game where players step into the shoes of a traveler trying to gain access to a guarded medieval city. The core gameplay revolves around interacting with NPCs, particularly a gatekeeper, to guess the correct password and gain entry. Leveraging the power of AI-driven dialogue via ChatGPT, players can engage in dynamic conversations, gather clues, and deduce the secret password.
